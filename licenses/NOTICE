jsfluids is distributed in the NPM repository along with a third-party library called rom.js, which is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL). The rom.js package is responsible for compiling the ITHACA-FV class, and it generates two separate chunks: ithacafv.browser.js for browser environments and ithacafv.index.js for Node.js environments. These chunks are loaded dynamically only when requested by the user, allowing for selective usage of the library.
